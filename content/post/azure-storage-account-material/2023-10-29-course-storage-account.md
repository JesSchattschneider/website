Below are some good material I used to learn more about Azure Storage Account:

- course: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-azure-storage-account/?source=recommendations

- documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/create-data-lake-storage-account

- tutorial: https://docs.informatica.com/integration-cloud/data-integration-connectors/h2l/1357-prerequisites-to-create-a-microsoft-azure-data-lake-storage/prerequisites-to-create-a-microsoft-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2.html


`The downside of having a single Storage account is that it will be hard to monitor costs per project.`
