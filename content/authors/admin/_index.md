I'm a data scientist passionate about using data tools to optimize processes and elevate the quality of data analysis.

My journey in data science is rooted in my background as a trained oceanographer and geospatial analyst. This foundation has shaped my career, driving me to use data tools to address complex environmental questions.

As I progressed in my career, I witnessed the inherent challenges within the world of science and research, where lack of data management and accessibility often delay progress. This realization has led me to embark on a new path: data engineering. I strongly believe that, before diving into analysis, we must build robust and resilient data pipelines. 

My work now is a mix of data science and data engineering, exposing me to different projects and tools, where I apply my expertise to ensure that data is not only analysed effectively but also managed efficiently from its source to its destination. On doing this, I aim to bridge the gap between data discovery and data analysis, fostering a more streamlined and insightful scientific process.

Follow me here while I navigate the intersection of data science, data engineering, and environmental data. For more details of my work, check my [posts](/#posts) and some of my past and ongoing [projects](/#projects).
